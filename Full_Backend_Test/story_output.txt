Title: "Snapshots of Consequence: The Sunnyville Camera Mystery"
Outline: Introduction:
In Sunnyville, there lived a kind teenager named Alex. He was curious and loved photography, always seen with his camera. One day, he discovered a mysterious, old camera at his grandpa's attic that changed everything.

1. Discovering the Power:
While taking pictures around Sunnyville, Alex took a photo of a mean stray cat that always bothered the neighborhood pets. The next day, the cat strangely disappeared. Alex felt worried but thought it was just a strange coincidence.

2. Testing the Power:
Curious but cautious, Alex decided to test the power of the camera again. This time, he took a picture of a wilting flower in his backyard. The next morning, the flower was completely gone. This made Alex realize the camera had the power to make things disappear just by taking their photo.

3. The Moral Struggle:
Feeling both scared and responsible, Alex wondered what he should do with the camera. He thought about taking pictures of bad things, but worried about making mistakes. "Is it right to use the camera?" he pondered, feeling the weight of his power.

4. Seeking Advice:
Alex decided he needed help and went to his wise grandpa, telling him about the camera and its power. His grandpa listened carefully, nodding. "Using power wisely is a big responsibility," he said, suggesting Alex think deeply about the consequences of his actions.

(Note: The story intentionally leaves readers at a point where Alex is contemplating his next steps, encouraging them to think about what they would do in his situation, and emphasizing the importance of responsibility and ethical decision-making.)
