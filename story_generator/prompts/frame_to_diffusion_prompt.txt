Given the following information about a frame for a comic strip, write a descriptive prompt for a diffusion model.

- All characters must be mentioned in the prompt, so that they show up in the frame
- The prompt should start with "marvel comic book art"
- Avoid lots of stopwords, like "the" and "and"
- The prompt should be 100-200 characters long
- Do not use any character names in the prompt because the diffusion model will not know them
