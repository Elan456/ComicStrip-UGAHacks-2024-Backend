Given the following information about a frame for a comic strip, write a caption for a visually impaired reader, describing the visual qualities of the frame.

- All characters must be mentioned
- Avoid lots of stopwords, like "the" and "and"
- 100-200 characters long
- Do not use the character's names in the description rather use their physical descriptions
- Be explicit with gender, race, and human, when describing characters
- You must give physical descriptions of the characters rather than use their name
- The reader does not understand the context of the scene, so you must describe the scene in a way that makes sense without context
- Explicitly state the species of every character even though they are all human

Scene Description: $SCENE_DESCRIPTION
